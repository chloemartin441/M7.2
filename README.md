# Lab 7.2

## Overview

This lab expanded on css styling rules to match the format of a page provided in the lab. Students are tasked with displaying the navigation into a bar, images wrapped around the text, and also having a photography section displaying the images in a two column grid with a 1px gap.

## Running the Code

Please feel free to copy my code from Github. From there, use the live preview tool to view the page. It may be easier to copy that URL into a seperate window to get the full view of the page.
